Estimation of MI variance

This repo contains the code for a project, the goal of which was to examine various characteristics of robust variance estimation methods in the literature, such as the bias of the point estimator, confidence interval width, coverage probability, and computational cost. The methods examined draw from Bayesian and frequentist frameworks to construct various estimators using bootstrap resampling combined with multiple imputation. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate the characteristics mentioned above of variance estimation methods in the literature, which was later used to develop an alternative jackknife estimator. The work describing the jackknife estimator developed can be found [here](https://ieb2.github.io/thesis/).
