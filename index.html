<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Missing data is an issue ubiquitous in many fields of science. Given
that statistical procedures often require data to be fully observed,
there has long been an interest and need to manage missing data in a way
that allows researchers to reach valid conclusions. Today, multiple
imputation is accepted as the gold standard in missing data analysis, in
no short thanks to the work of Donald Rubin <span class="citation">(Buuren 2012)</span>. In 1977, Rubin proposed using
multiple completed versions of the dataset with missing observations,
applying the complete-data procedure of interest, and pooling the
estimates to draw valid inferences <span class="citation">(Buuren
2012)</span>. The main advantage of multiple imputation, as opposed to
single imputation, which had been used by researchers since the early
1970s, is its ability to properly estimate the variance caused by
missing observations <span class="citation">(Efron 1994)</span>. The
emphasis placed on variance and uncertainty by Rubin was a departure
from the status quo of the time, which was to fill in the missing
observation with the most probable value and to proceed with complete
case analyses as if the observation had not been missing, to begin with
<span class="citation">(Buuren 2012)</span>. This approach, however,
fails to incorporate the loss of information caused by missing
observations into the estimation of parameters, resulting in the
underestimation of variance <span class="citation">(Rubin
1978)</span>.</p>
<p>Like all revolutionary ideas, multiple imputation received harsh
criticism following its conception. Perhaps the most notable of the
objections came from Fay in 1992, who demonstrated through
counterexamples that multiple imputation produced biased covariance
estimates <span class="citation">(Bartlett and Hughes 2020)</span>. Fay
added the need for unison between the imputation and analysis model made
multiple imputation a poor general-purpose tool, particularly in
instances where the imputer and analyst are different individuals <span class="citation">(Fay 1992; Buuren 2012)</span>. Fay’s arguments led to
the conceptualization of congeniality<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> between the imputation and analysis model,
which was later accepted to be a requirement to obtain valid inferences
from multiple imputation using Rubin’s pooling rules <span class="citation">(Buuren 2012; Meng 1994)</span>. Although Fay’s work
initially criticized biases introduced to the covariance matrix
following multiple imputation, a similar phenomenon of biased
estimations were observed with variance under uncongeniality <span class="citation">(Fay 1992; Meng 1994; Xie and Meng 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest works demonstrating Rubin’s variance estimator
to be biased under uncongeniality were from Wang_1998 and Robins in
1998, who also proposed an alternate variance estimator in the same
paper <span class="citation">(Buuren 2012)</span>. The variance
estimator proposed by Wang and Robins requires the calculation of
several quantities, which are not easily accessible to the average
statistical practitioner <span class="citation">(Bartlett and Hughes
2020)</span>. The challenging construction of the variance estimator
proposed by Wang and Robins has resulted in it receiving little-to-no
attention in applied settings <span class="citation">(Bartlett and
Hughes 2020)</span>. In an attempt to create a more user-friendly
variance estimator in instances of suspected uncongeniality, researchers
have proposed combining resampling methods with multiple imputation. Of
the two main resampling methods, bootstrap has received more attention
from multiple imputation researchers compared to jackknife resampling,
which has mostly been investigated under single hot-deck imputation.
Although particular combinations of bootstrap and multiple imputation
have been demonstrated to create asymptotically unbiased estimates of
variance, the associated computational cost makes this an active area of
research <span class="citation">(Bartlett and Hughes 2020)</span>. Most
recently, von Hippel has proposed a bootstrap variance estimator which
addresses the issue of computational cost; however, it has been
demonstrated to create confidence intervals that are slightly wider
compared to traditional bootstrap and multiple imputation combinations
<span class="citation">(Bartlett and Hughes 2020)</span>. Given the
lower computational cost associated with jackknife resampling, as well
as desirable properties demonstrated under single imputation, such as
being unbiased in certain scenarios, it is an attractive alternative
that should be considered as a variance estimator of multiply imputed
data under uncongeniality <span class="citation">(Chen and Shao 2001;
Rao and Shao 1992)</span>.</p>

<h1>Research Methods</h1>
<p>For the proposed Monte Carlo simulation, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 999 datasets will be generated with
the following characteristics: A response variable, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(p_{miss} \in \{0.10, 0.30, 0.50\}\)</span>
proportion of missing observations, where the mechanism of missingness
is missing at random (MAR), and an <span class="math inline">\(n \times
q\)</span> matrix of fully observed covariates, where <span class="math inline">\(n \in \{500, 1000, 10000\}\)</span> is the sample
size, and <span class="math inline">\(q = 3\)</span> is the number of
covariates. Moreover, two of the covariates will be simulated such that
there is an interaction between them. During the imputation phase of the
study, the uncongenial imputation model will ignore such interaction,
whereas the congenial imputation model will accommodate it.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> datasets generated
with the foregoing characteristics will be imputed using the function.
In order to determine <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, which
represents the number of complete datasets to be generated per <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, von Hippel’s two-stage <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> calculator will be utilized <span class="citation">(Hippel 2020)</span>. The imputation process will be
visually monitored for convergence using a pilot study with small <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, which will help determine the maximum
number of iterations each combination of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are allowed to go through. Finally, the
imputation method for the outcome variable will be predictive mean
matching.</p>
<p>Initially, the imputation model utilized by will be uncongenial to
the analysis model, per the definition of congeniality set forth in
Appendix B. Thereafter, the analysis model of interest to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> will be applied to each of the
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> datasets, and <span class="math inline">\(\text{var}(\hat{\theta})\)</span> will be
estimated using the jackknife estimator. The foregoing process will be
repeated under a congenial imputation and analysis model pairing, which
will serve as the control. All analyses will be conducted using 4.2.0
(Vigorous Calisthenics), alongside 3.14.0, 1.0.0, 1.2.0, and 1.3.1.</p>

<h2>Formal Definition of Congeniality</h2>
<p>In short, one may define congeniality as the imputer and analyst
making different assumptions regarding the data. The following two-part
formal definition of uncongeniality was proposed by Meng in 1994, and
will be utilized in our research. Meeting the assumptions set forth in
the following two definitions qualifies the imputation model as being
congenial to the analysis model, or vice versa.</p>
<div id="definition-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Definition 1</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(E_f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_f\)</span> denote posterior mean and variance
with respect to <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, respectively. A
Bayesian model <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is said to be
congenial to the analysis procedure <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{P} \equiv \{\mathscr{P}_{obs};
\mathscr{P}_{com}\}\)</span> for given <span class="math inline">\(Z_o\)</span> if the following hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The posterior mean and variance of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> given the incomplete data are
asymptotically the same as the estimate and variance from the analyst’s
incomplete-data procedure <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{P}_{obs}\)</span>, that is, <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
    [\hat{\theta}(Z_o), U(Z_o)] \simeq [E_f[\theta | Z_o], V_f[\theta |
Z_o]]
\end{equation}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The posterior mean and variance of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> given the complete data are
asymptotically the same as the estimate and variance from the analyst’s
complete-data procedure <span class="math inline">\(\mathscr{P}_{com}\)</span>, that is, <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
     [\hat{\theta}(Z_c), U(Z_c)] \simeq [E_f[\theta | Z_c], V_f[\theta |

conditioned upon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the foregoing conditions are met, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is said to be second-moment congenial
